Kristen has the ability to add the reining discipline to my team penning horse and she has shown me that I can be competitive in the reining classes too. She has an eye to see things in the young horses and in the experienced ones.  Kristen has the integrity, determination and knowledge that I feel is so important in choosing a Trainer. If you are looking for a new home for you and your horse, come and see for yourself at this beautiful facility!",
